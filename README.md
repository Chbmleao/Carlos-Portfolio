## About

- **Carlos Leão Portfolio** is an application that provides information about the projects I have worked on, my experiences and my journey. You can also contact me by sending me an email through this application.

- The main goal of this project was to create a platform for people to get to know me better.

- The project was developed using [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/).

- The website offers support for both English and Portuguese languages.
